# Ez-Citations
Ez citations is a citation manager created because dealing with citations is annoying. Whether you need it for homework, projects, or presentations, Ez citations has your back! Functionality includes adding, editing, sorting, and annotating citations, and much more!

## How to use it

First you need to install Java (at least version 8). Then you can run the java files, and to start it up you will need to compile and run "Main.java." The manual on how to use this can be found after you run it.
